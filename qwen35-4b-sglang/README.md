# Chat with Qwen3.5 4B and SGLang

Serve Qwen3.5-4B on one RTX 4090 through an OpenAI-compatible API. SGLang downloads the weights when it starts.

## Run

From this repository's root, after `vkong login`:

```bash
cd qwen35-4b-sglang
vkong run
```

Keep the terminal open. Copy the local URL printed by VKong into a second terminal:

```bash
export VKONG_URL=http://127.0.0.1:<local-port>
python3 -m pip install openai
python3 client.py
```

## Run in the background

Use `vkong run --detach` when starting a service that should outlive the terminal.
To publish it at an HTTPS URL, run `vkong deploy` from this directory.
Use that URL as `VKONG_URL` with the same client.

## Stop

```bash
vkong app stop qwen35-4b-sglang
```

This releases the machine and stops compute billing.

## Model cache

The framework downloads the model to the rental's local disk. That cache is
removed when the machine is released, and a new machine downloads it again.
Do not add `storage` to this service: workspace volumes are for training tasks
that write checkpoints to `/data`.

## Customize

Edit `vkong.yaml` for compute requirements and the hourly price limit.
Change the model or context size in `serve.sh`. The example uses a 2,048-token context.
